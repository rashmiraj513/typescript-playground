# TypeScript Playground Repository

Welcome to my TypeScript Learning repository! This repository is dedicated to helping me learn and practice TypeScript. It contains a variety of exercises, tutorial codes, and mini-projects designed to enhance my understanding of TypeScript.

## Installing TypeScript

To install TypeScript, you need to install the Node.js. After installing the Node.js, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g typescript # If you want to install the TypeScript globally.
npm install -D typescript # If you want to install the TypeScript as a dev dependency.
```

> **Note:** To check whether TypeScript is installed or not, run the following command: `npm list -g`. This will list all the npm packages which is installed globally. Here, you can see the typescript package with the version. If here, there is no typescript, then you need to install the TypeScript again.
